				Every year at the Frankfurt Book Fair, about 400,000 books are presented. This makes it the largest book fair in the world. Of course, these are printed books made of ink, paper, glue, etc. not digital books. Despite what is frequently said about the supposed bad state of the economy of the sector, this number raises many interrogations. We keep on hearing about the “death of the book”; about how printing could not survive the age of digital transmissions.
Whether it is true or not this appears to remain an important issue. Books are material. As mentioned before, they are made of paper, ink, glue, threads, sometimes linen, leather etc. Material things do not last forever. This is a fact. Nevertheless, the knowledge they carry, their stories and the forms they use are the fundamentals of Mankind. This is a heritage that must be preserved.
However it looks as if we rely more and more on digital ways for spreading information and knowledge, as if it was certain that this, and everything that is related to our lives, will last forever that way. From the floppy disk to the Cloud, we have seen many digital techniques to save and expand our data. The Internet seems to have become the climax of this new information sharing activity. Although, its being immaterial makes it hard to picture its lasting value…Are digital media and the Internet really a sustainable alternative to printing? And when it comes to graphic design, is it even possible to consider one that would last forever, whether it is digital or printed matter?</p></a>

<a name="introduction"><p div class="p3"><br><u>INTRODUCTION</u></br>We often hear that a writer is a witness of his time. Nowadays, with the fast development of means of communication,
everybody can write and give their views and thoughts on the world. This readiness damages the lasting
quality of the information that is shared.
We publish, we print, we upload, we blog, we share, on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram, and then we throw
away and simply forget. All this, without worrying for even one second about the possible future of this written
and visual material, mirror of our society.
Graphic design is the process of visual communication, and problem-solving through the use of type, space,
image and color (Wikipedia definition). According to Annick Lantennois, a French art historian specialised in
graphic design history and theory, “graphic design can be defined as the formal processing of information and
knowledge. The graphic designer is a mediator who acts on the conditions of reception and appropriation of the
information and knowledge to which he gives shape.”2 To that definition I would merely add that the designer
has a duty to give shape to information in order to convince them of reading it. Therefore, the notion of lasting
value can be essential.
This thesis questions the possibility of creating a graphic design that would last forever. A graphic design,
using typography, images or new media, that would help to preserve knowledge and information, the History of
Mankind forever (or almost).
To try and tackle this issue, I intend to find out how it would be possible to preserve this very thesis.
That way I will research on the history of printing, its conservation and its so-called “death”, on the one hand.
On the other hand, I will focus on the chronology of our digital era, the different aspects of digital conservation
and problems such as the data pollution and E-Waste. Eventually, I will try and figure out the several issues that
can be connected with the very idea of an everlasting graphic design, focusing on the matters of updates and
trends.</br></p></a>
