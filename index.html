			<p class="p2" id="txt2">Every year at the Frankfurt Book Fair —the largest in the world—, are presented about 400,000 books. These are, of course, printed books made of ink, paper, glue, etc… Not digital books. Despite what is frequently said about the supposed bad economy of the sector, that number still leaves us thoughtful. Indeed, we keep on hearing about the "death of the book": about how printing could not survive the age of digital transmissions.
<br>Wether it is true or not this appears to remain an important issue. Books are material. As mentioned before, they are made of paper, ink, glue, threads, sometimes linen, leather etc. Everything that is material does not last forever. This is a fact. Nevertheless, the knowledge they carry and their stories are the fundamentals of the Human kind. This is a heritage that must be preserved. </br> </p>

			<p class="p2" id="txt4">However it seems that we rely more and more on digital ways for archiving and spreading information and knowledge, as if it is for sure that this and everything that is related to our lives will last forever in that manner. From the floppy disks to the Cloud, we have seen so many digital techniques to save our data. The Internet seems to have become the climax of this new archiving activity. Nevertheless, its being immaterial makes it hard to figure its lasting value through time…
Are digital archives and the Internet really a sustainable alternative to printing? Is it even possible to design ever-lasting ways of preserving and spreading knowledge?  </p>
