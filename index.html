     --><div class="texte"><h2>ABSTRACT</h2><p>Every year at the Frankfurt Book Fair, about 400,000 books are presented. This makes it the largest book fair in the world. Of course, these are printed books made of ink, paper, glue, etc. not digital books. Despite what is frequently said about the supposed bad state of the economy of the sector, this number raises many interrogations. We keep on hearing about the “death of the book”; about how printing could not survive the age of digital transmissions.<p><!--
        --><p>Whether it is true or not, this appears to remain an important issue. Books are material. And material things do not last forever. This is a fact. Nevertheless, the knowledge they carry, their stories and the forms they use are the fundamentals of Mankind. This is a heritage that must be preserved.<p><!--
        --><p>However, it looks as if we rely more and more on digital ways for spreading information and knowledge, as if it was certain that this, and everything that is related to our lives, will last forever that way. From the floppy disk to the Cloud, we have seen many digital techniques to save and expand our data. The Internet seems to have become the climax of this new information sharing activity. Although, its being immaterial makes it hard to picture its lasting value…<p><!--
        --><p>Are digital media and the Internet really a sustainable alternative to printing? And when it comes to graphic design, is it even possible to consider one that would last forever, whether it is digital or printed matter?<p><!--
        --><p>This thesis aims to prove the importance of pre-servation as any “graphically designed” item, created in a specific context, witnesses a certain moment in a certain society. <a href="#hidden3">Because knowing the past allows to shape the future.</a></p></div></div></div></div>

        --><h2>INTRO-<br>DUCTION</h2><!--
        --><p>We often hear that a writer is a witness of his time. Nowadays, with the fast developments of means of communication, everybody can write and give their views and thoughts on the world. This readiness damages the lasting quality of the information that is shared. We publish, we print, we upload, we blog, we share and then we throw away and simply forget. All this, without worrying for even one second about the possible future of this written and visual material, mirror of our society.</p><!--
        --><p>Graphic design is the process of visual commu-nication and problem-solving through the use of type, space, image and color<sup class="ref">1</sup>. According to Annick Lantennois, a French art historian specialised in graphic design history and theory, “Graphic design can be defined as the formal processing of information and knowledge. The graphic designer is a mediator who acts on the conditions of reception and appropriation of the information and knowledge to which he gives shape.”<sup class="ref">2</sup> To that definition I would merely add that the designer has a duty to give shape to information in order to convince people of reading it. Therefore, the notion of lasting value can be essential.</p><!--
        --><p>With this thesis I want to question the possibility of creating a graphic design that would last forever. A graphic design, using typography, images or new media,  that would help to preserve knowledge and information, the History of Mankind forever (or almost). To try and tackle this issue, I intend to find out how it would be possible to preserve this very thesis.</p><!--
        --><p>That way I will investigate on the history of prin-ting, its conservation and its so-called “death”, on the one hand. On the other hand, I will focus on the chronology of our digital era, the different aspects of digital conservation and problems such as the data pollution and E-Waste. Eventually, I will try and figure out the several issues that can be connected with the very idea of an everlasting graphic design, focusing on the matters of updates and trends.</p></div><!--

        --><p>We are surrounded by books<sup class="ref">3</sup>. They are everywhere and about everything. Isn’t it fascinating to think that whatever topic you want to share about, you can possibly put it into a book and publish it?<p><!--
        --><p>WIt was not always like this. Printing and publishing have been through a long process to become as accessible as they are nowadays.<p><!--
        --><p>The history of printing goes to very early times (with the duplication of images using stamps). The use of round seals for rolling an impression into clay tablets goes back to early Mesopotamian civilization (before 3000 BC)<sup class="ref">4</sup>. Since then the development of printing has made it possible for books, newspapers, magazines, and other reading materials to be produced in great numbers and plays an important role in promoting literacy among the masses. But of course, books already existed before in a different form : handwritten on parchment, this ancient kind of manuscripts was called  a codex.<p><!--
        --><p>Around 1400, the technique of printing from wood blocks was introduced in Europe. As in the East, the images were printed by the simple method of laying a piece of paper on a carved and inked block and then rubbing its back to transfer the ink. And as in the East, the main market was holy images for sale to pilgrims.<p><!--
        --><p>Later in the 15th century, technical advances were made in Germany which rapidly transform printing from a tiny industry to a milestone of western civilization. By then, the name of Gutenberg first appeared in connection with printing. In Mainz, Gutenberg’s great achievement in the story of printing had several components. One  of them was his development of the printing press, capable of applying a rapid but steady downward pressure. The concept of the press was not new but existing presses exerted slow pressure — uneconomical in printing. His first publication was a full-length Bible in Latin, printed to the standards of the best black-letter manuscripts. The new technology spread rapidly. Gutenberg’s method was ideal for combining text and illustration on the same page. Movable type could be set in any shape round a wood block. The raised surfaces of both type and image would receive the ink together and could transfer it to the paper at a single impression.</p></div><!--

        --><p>The profusion of presses in Europe by the early 16th century meant that the machinery was in place for a different and entirely new form of production — the rapid printing of pamphlets, or even single sheets, which could be used for propaganda.<p><!--
        --><p>In the end of the 18th century, Alois Senefelder made a discovery of great significance in the history of printing: lithography. With this technique, marks are made on a stone surface in greasy crayon or ink. The stone is then wetted. Newly applied ink will stick only to the greasy marks. Paper pressed against the stone will pick up those marks and nothing else. In his book The Work of Art at the Age of Mechanical Reproduction, Walter Benjamin says that “with lithography, reproductive technology reaches a radically new stage”<sup class="ref">5</sup>.<p><!--
        --><p>“The very much speedier process represented by applying a drawing to a stone [...] enabled graphic art , for the first time, to market its products not only in great numbers (as previously) but also in different designs daily”<sup class="ref">6</sup>.<p><!--
        --><p>From that moment on, the noticeable advances in printing technology opened completely new possibilities for publishers and designers : printed objects of a new kind emerged.<p><!--
        --><p>In the 19th century, stereotyping (allowing for whole sheets to be set at once) gave publishers the opportunity to reach new populations of readers through magazines and newspapers and also to expand the world of book-buyers. In Britain and America, the “Yellowbacks” and dime novels started off as affordable reprints of older books. That meant not having to pay authors but in time the publishers came to experiment with new types of content that reflected readers’ interests. What’s more, bright and cheerful, the chromolithograph, printed in several colours, each from a separate stone, is a characteristic feature of 19th century commercial printing — seen in posters, book plates and eventually in magazines.<p><!--
        --><p>Today, offset printing is a widely used commercial printing technique. The inked image is transferred from a plate to a rubber blanket, then to the printing surface. Also, digital printing, with laser printers, is more and more popular for commercial use because of</p></div><!--

        --><p>its being cheap. Nevertheless, it is important to notice that this lower cost involves a huge lack of quality (in typography and images). This being said, this lack of quality is often used by designers as a creative challenge to produce visually interesting but cheap to produce printed objects. In the same trend,  another widespread printing technique, nowadays, and striking when it comes to conservation and archiving documents is the photocopier. Just as with digital printing, this method gives designers many bounderies forcing them to push the limits of their creative capacities.</p><p>This list is most certainly non-exhaustive (let us not forget about screenprinting, very appreciated by poster designers, or even home printers, offering to each and everyone of us the possibility to print anything, anytime...) but it already gives us an idea of the amount of books and other printed items that might have been published since Gutenberg’s 42-line Bible. Many objects containing huge amounts of knowledge using different forms and designs... How do we manage to help them survive the injustice that is time?

        --><h2>On book<br>and print<br>care</h2><!--
        --><p>According to the online encyclopedia Wikipedia “a book is a set of written, printed, illustrated, or blank sheets, made of ink, paper, parchment, or other materials, fastened together to hinge at one side”. The book is a pure item of the design<sup class="ref">7</sup>: its form is always thought according to its function and/or to its content. In A Book of the Book : some works and projections about the book and writing,  Keith A. Smith writes about “The Book as Physical Object”. The essay develops on the many different ways of “building” a book: from the lay-out, to the printing, to the binding. “The book, as object, is intimate, it insists on a one-to-one confrontation : the bookmaker and viewer.”<sup class="ref">8</sup><p><!--
        --><p>The conservation and restoration of books is an activity dedicated to the preservation and protection of objects of historical and personal value. Paper based items, such as books, manuscripts, maps, newspapers, posters and postcatrds present distinctive concerns when it comes to care and conservation. Unlike works of art on paper, these items are handled directly and repeatedly.<p><!--
        --><p>Books represents a huge part of our historical heritage. On its online platform, the University of Chicago, Illinoy, presents in detail a course of “Art and Science of Book Conversation”. There you can read that “conservation is an essential component of preserving the library’s collections. Using current knowledge of degradation pathways as well as traditional skills, conservators prevent and stop the degradation of library collections like rare books and archival materials. Conservation treatment may include a combination of chemical treatments such as aqueous deacidification —the process of washing paper in a bath of purified water enriched with alkaline chemicals— and traditional treatments like rebinding a book with broken sewing”<sup class="ref">9</sup>. Therefore, most countries have in there national libraries a Conservation department. Conservation of the collections in order to be communicated to present and future generations is one of the main duties of the Bibliothèque nationale de France ; for this purpose, a conservation policy has been implemented and oriented to both preventive and curative. This fundamental mission was entrusted to the library by its founding decree of January 3rd, 1994 : “Collect, catalog, maintain and enhance, in all fields of</p></div><!--

     --><div class="texte"><p>knowledge, the national heritage in its custody [...] and to provide access to the collections to the largest audience.” Throughout its history, the library has developed techniques that are appropriated to that mission. To the traditional activity of curative conservation and binding, new ones have been added : prevention, preservation, awareness and education of staff, digitization, research... The laboratory allows a real scientific approach thanks to the development of material analysis methods, their conditions of aging and degradation. This task applies to heritage collections gathered on behalf of the Nation for centuries : “French and foreign collections of prints, manuscripts, coins and medals, prints, photographs, maps, music, choreography, sound documents, audio-visual and computerized documents”<sup class="ref">10</sup>. Over the last centuries an ever growing set of collections has been built whose growth is continuously accelerating ; today this set is estimated at over 30 million documents and hundreds of terabytes of digital data. <p>It is fascinating to see how some books survive centuries... In 44BC Cicero (a Roman orator) wrote a book for his son : De Officiis (“On Duties”) told him how to live a moral life, how to balance virtue with self-interest. The book refers to the views of various Greek philosophers of whom many works have been lost. De Officiis was read and studied throughout the rise of the Roman Empire and survived its fall. Cicero probably dictated De Officiis to a slave who copied it down on a papyrus scroll from which other copies were made in turn. The lush 15th century edition was printed in Mainz, Germany, on a printing press owned by Johann Fust (early partner of Johannes Gutenberg). Nowadays this beautiful volume can be found in the Huntington Library in San Marino, California, since 1916. Few physical volumes survive five centuries and this one should last several more. The incredible building from 1951 that protects it and tens of thousands of other volumes was originally meant to double as a nuclear-bomb shelter. Beautifully printed and condensing the knowledge and thoughts of many philosophers of a time from which not many traces were left behind, this book is a treasure and witness of a different age. Already important by Cicero’s time, it was a classic source of wisdom around</p></div><!--

        --><p>Conversation is a practice that has been thought of for many years already. On another hand the conservation of posters remains more complicated. Posters are ephemeral. More than books can be. They promote an event and once that event is over, the poster has no more appeal. Nevertheless, our societies tend to acknowledge more and more the artistic value of graphic design in all its forms. And the poster is, without any doubt, one of its most important historical embodimenst. For instance, the Chaumont Graphic Design Festival, in Chaumont (France), is now working on a big project : the CIG11 (Centre International du Graphisme), opening its doors in May 2016, is meant to be a graphic design center where a collection of about 40,000 contemporary posters will be conserved, compiled since the festival’s inception, and enriched by about 2,000 pieces each year.  Chaumont is  probably not the only organisation that conserves graphic design (mostly printed matter) that way; in 2013, we could count around fifty different events around the world celebrating graphic design, and organising competitions (involving poster design and book design). Also, the Poster Museum at Wilanów is the oldest institution of that kind in the world. In 1953, around 500 posters that had survived the war were transferred from the Engravings Department of the National Museum in Warsaw to the Documentation Section, which just had been established. The Poster Museum was opened on the day of the inauguration of the 2nd International Poster Biennial (1968). Nowadays, the museum collection is made of about 36.000 Polish posters and nearly 25.000 foreign posters12. <p><!--
        --><p> If both Chaumont and Wilanów collect that many posters every year and so many books are still presented in bookfairs, the idea of “Death of the book” (and of printing) appears like a true mystery to me. </p></div></div></div></div>
